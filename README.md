# Photobase

This responsive web app was built using React. The project makes use of my very own [Photobase-api]() to fetch random images from a database that I created.

The app is deployed with Netlify and can be accesed here: [Photobase]().

# Purpose

I made this app as a gift for my friends. I wanted to compile the many special moments we shared over the past years, and so I gathered as much photographs of us as I could. 

I created a REST API first to handle the data processing on the backend and then made this client side application. This project turned out to be a great way to practice the skills I love and to share them with those who I love as well.

## Installation

The app is already deployed so you can play around with the final product using this [link](https://crypt0-app.netlify.app/).

If you wish to run the app locally, clone this repo and install the dependencies.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/elewites/CryptoApp.git
$ cd cryptoapp
$ npm install
```

Once the dependencies install, run the following command on your terminal:

`npm start`

This will run the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
