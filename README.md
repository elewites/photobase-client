# Photobase

This responsive web app was built using React. The project makes use of my very own [Photobase-api]() to fetch random images from a database that I created.

The app is deployed with Netlify and can be accesed here: [Photobase]().

# Purpose

I made this app as a gift for my friends. I wanted to compile all the special moments we have shared over the past years, and so I started by gathering as much photographs of us as I could.

Then, created a REST API to handle the data processing on the backend and after made this client side application. The project turned out to be a great way to practice the skills I love and to share them with those who I love the most.

## Installation

The app is already deployed so you can play around with the final product using this [link]().

If you wish to run the app locally, clone this repo and install the dependencies.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/elewites/photobase-client.git
$ cd cryptoapp
$ npm install
```

Once the dependencies install, run the following command on your terminal:

`npm start`

This will run the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

# User Stories

### These user stories I always create when I am designing a new app. 

### They help me systematically work through the design process.

1. The user should be able to click the random photo button to generate a new random image.

2. Upon refresh the user should see a new image being displayed.

3. The user should be able to dowload the displayed image as JPEG file.
